If you collaborated with anyone list their cslogins here: sallotey and scomlan

please tell us how you tested your scraper function:
We couldn't exactly code to test for anything specific as the page updates
itself so we checked that it produced the correct type of data.
We also ran the function on webpages to see if produced the right values
(we did not include this in testing because it would output too much data)
